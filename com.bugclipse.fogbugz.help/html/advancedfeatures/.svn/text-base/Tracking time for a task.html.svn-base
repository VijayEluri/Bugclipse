<br><ul><li>A task can be activated by clicking on the activation
button in the task list or task editor. Doing so turns on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Working
On</span> attribute in the FogBugz repository to point to the current task.
Similarly, deactivation of task informs the repository to stop tracking
time for the case. This facility is greatly useful while tracking time
spent using FogBugz.</li></ul><p>

focused context (See&nbsp;<a href="Context%20attachment.html">Context attachment</a>).
Deactivating a task can result in editors being closed. To change these
default options, please use the preference page Window -&gt;
Preferences -&gt; Mylyn -&gt; Context<br></li><li>When a task is
active, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">focused context</span> shows only the part of the code that is relevant to the active task. This can help focus on the task at hand.</li></ul><p>
